Automate Proxy Server Settings In Linux
If you use the same proxy server settings for the https, http and ftp traffic, you can use the following commands to set and unset the proxy settings:

$ export {http,https,ftp}_proxy="http://PROXY_SERVER:PORT"
$ unset {http,https,ftp}_proxy
If you use a proxy server often, you can create Bash functions as follows (add to your ~/.bashrc file):

# Set Proxy
function setproxy() {
    export {http,https,ftp}_proxy="http://PROXY_SERVER:PORT"
}

# Unset Proxy
function unsetproxy() {
    unset {http,https,ftp}_proxy
}
Reload your ~/.bashrc file.

$ source ~/.bashrc
